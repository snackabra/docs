<h2>Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As we are first writing this in March of 2022, you might think there are
enough options for messaging, chatting, photo sharing, social
networking, file storage, video, forums, and so on and so forth. It’s
a multi-hundred billion dollar business today - arguably a trillion
dollar business on the whole.</p>
<p>But that’s actually the problem.</p>
<p>What we have discovered in the past 10 years or so is something quite
disconcerting: that this area of communication software (or however
you want to label the category) is a key to influencing people, and
hence, incredibly profitable. Profitable to the point that all these
supposed options available to us are in fact crowding out alternatives
that, were we fully informed and had access to such alternatives, we
would prefer. In fact, arguably, the “system” is countering the
evolution of any such alternatives.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we will use the term “collaboration” to
cover apps and services that we otherwise would label as “chat”,
“messaging”, “file sharing”, “file storage”, and so forth. We do
no necessarily include “social networking”, but there is an
overlap: sharing photos with a group of family and friends, for
example, is essentially collaboration.</p>
<p>The net result of industry developments is that the options available
for collaboration software are few, and if we apply our mondern
understanding of terms such as “privacy”, “security”, and
“data sovereignty”, then arguably there are zero good options.</p>
<p>Historically, this would have been very difficult to do much
about.  But there have been a few technical “equalizers” that have
developed in the past several years that provides an opportunity to
change things. Before we get to that, let us first try to be more
concrete. The following list introduces the requirements that we
<em>should</em> apply - and when we <em>do</em> apply these criteria to all the
options available today, not a single one (zero) fullfil them.</p>
<p>We will first introduce these points very briefly, and then go into
some detail on each. We want a messaging and file sharing
(collaboration) service to be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#discussion-open-source"><span class="std std-ref">Open Source</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#discussion-interoperable"><span class="std std-ref">Interoperable</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#discussion-participant-control"><span class="std std-ref">Under participant control</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#discussion-vendor-independent"><span class="std std-ref">Vendor-independent</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#discussion-private"><span class="std std-ref">Private</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#discussion-secure"><span class="std std-ref">Secure</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#discussion-legal-oversight"><span class="std std-ref">Compatible with legal oversight</span></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below we will cover them in order from the simplest to the
hardest. They do not really have a clear ordering in terms of
priorities: they are <em>all</em> necessary criteria, as we will argue.
Later on we will by necessity go into priorities, since there are some
trade-offs.</p>
<p>We begin with talking about Data Rights: much of the criteria above
follow from formulating what we mean by Data Rights, and then applying
that systematically.</p>
<section id="data-rights">
<span id="discussion-data-rights"></span><h3>Data Rights<a class="headerlink" href="#data-rights" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A number of smart people have developed precise and concrete
guidelines for what rights you <em>should</em> have to data. We do not have
genuine legal rights that align with these: today we might think of
them as “natural rights” re-applied to our current digitized condition.</p>
<p>To pick a few examples, here we paraphrase from the User Data
Manifesto that was written by Frank Karlitschek <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f092" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and Hugo Roy
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f093" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Control:</em> User data should be under the ultimate control of the
user, including any “metadata”. Users should be able to decide whom
to grant direct access to their data and with which permissions and
licenses should be granted.</p>
<p><em>Transparency:</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f091" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Users should know where their data is
stored, how it is stored, what is done with it, and what laws
apply.</p>
<p><em>Freedom:</em> Users should always be able to extract their data from
the service at any time without experiencing any vendor lock-in.
Any rights they’ve granted should always be revocable.</p>
<p class="attribution">—<a class="reference external" href="https://userdatamanifesto.org/">https://userdatamanifesto.org/</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Another powerful expression of our necessary rights to our data is a more
recent expression by Jeffrey H. Wernick:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The basis for any society to respect the individual is predicated
upon the sovereign individual. Our most important property right is
ourselves. If we lose ownership of ourselves, we become
enslaved. The property of others.</p>
<p>We are comprised of our attributes. That defines who we are. We are
the sum total of our attributes and more. Apparently there is great
commercial value in understanding our attributes and then using
what is learned, sometimes in our interests and sometimes against
our interests but never with our permission and never with the
recognition that we have not transferred copyright over ourselves
to others to be sold. We are being sold. That is slavery.</p>
<p>What we do. What we think. The activities we engage in. […]  We
are violated. We are dehumanized. It is outrageous. And it is
accomplished through deception. The selling of data is human
trafficking. The selling of contraband. A violation of our human
rights.</p>
<p class="attribution">—<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jeffreyhwernick.com/articles/data-manifesto">https://www.jeffreyhwernick.com/articles/data-manifesto</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Mission Statement from Magnusson Institute (initial funder of
Snackabra) is along the same lines. It is the lack of privacy that
allows for the collection of information about ourselves. Data Rights
along the lines of what Karlitschek, Roy, and Wernick seek to address.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Without privacy, the rights afforded to us are not just eroded,
they become meaningless.  Without privacy, our lives become cages
built from one-way mirrors. Others can look in, but we can’t see
them. This is not about everybody knowing everything about
everybody. It is about some entities – corporations, political
organizations, foreign governments, any group with a budget and a
purpose – gaining perfect information about us.  We won’t even know
who “they” are, let alone what they are up to.  Without privacy, we
lose our free will.  We become an asset for somebody’s algorithm.
We lose our agency, you think you are in control, but you’re really
not, and in the cruelest way – within an illusion that we retain
control.  Without privacy, we become pawns in a game we cannot see,
contributing to an outcome of which we are unaware. The course of
our lives will be to serve some unknown purpose.  Without privacy,
we lose not just individual agency, but collective agency. We
become powerless.  Without privacy, we lose more than freedom and
liberty.  We lose our humanity.  We become blind mice in a maze;
puppets on invisible strings.</em></p>
<p class="attribution">—<a class="reference external" href="https://www.magnusson.institute/about.html">https://www.magnusson.institute/about.html</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We will be referring back to these principles: <em>control</em>,
<em>transparency</em>, and <em>freedom</em>.</p>

<section id="open-source">
<span id="discussion-open-source"></span><h3>Open Source<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>All sorts of messaging projects claim that they are open source.  But
upon closer inspection they all exhibit a variety caveats, footnotes,
reservations, carve-outs, etc. Of course, many of these are driven by
the need to have some avenue of monetization. Examples of issues include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Systems where some key component is missing from the complete “set”
that you would need to run a system. Typically that component is
licensed commercially.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems where the code is free to use and host - as long as you
don’t compete with a named corporate entity.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems where key parts (such as the ‘client’ vs the ‘server’ side)
are distributed with different licensing models, or missing
completely.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems where the <em>server</em> side is distributed under a non-Afero-Style
license - we’ll explain this below.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems where key aspects of the documentation are either not
kept up to date, or are only available through separate commercial
licensing.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems where the code is technically available, but some aspects
of using the code is inpractical. For examnple, if the build process
is highly complex and not easily reproduced.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems which embed a number of commercial aspects, such as “phone
home” or paid “placement”, or embed lead generation to commercial
verions. These embeddings can be so numerous that it’s not practical
for a consumer of the code base (and updates) to keep up.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above are examples of real-world issues. It’s perhaps unfair to
single out any particular alternative, since any team is free to
pursue how they want to approach the problem (that of suffering the
expense of engineering yet provide freedom of us). However the problem
facing all of us, is that at the end of the day it is hard to find a
<em>single</em> viable system that does not suffer from one or more of these
issues.</p>
<p>The “Afero-style” licensing problem merits some elaboration, for
readers who are not familiar with the problem. If you are, you can
skip ahead a bit.</p>
<p>Briefly, the Open Source movement dates to a time when software was
delivered to a user to run on their computer. The principle at the
heart of Open Source was that you could use the source code freely,
and modify it for your own use, but if you ever were to re-distribute
it (freely or commercially), you were bound to also include your
changes and additions.  The “trigger” that would force you to share
your additional work was thus the notion of “distribution.”  This was
all before the modern Internet: Personal Computers, the World Wide
Web, and eventually the smartphone. Along came companies like Yahoo,
Ebay, Google, and Amazon, and they discovered that could essentially
“vaccum up” the entire open source world of code, make all the
improvements and changes they wanted, and, since they didn’t
“distribute” the code, they ran it on their own computers and offered
an “online service”, they never had to contribute back to open source.</p>
<p>This created a crisis - massive open source projects that had been
developed over decades were just absorbed and monetized. The Open Source
movement responded by developing new versions of licenses. Notably,
“GPL v3”, also referred to as an “Afero” license, adds a new trigger:
use of the software to deliver any sort of online service will force
the provider to share any changes and additions they’ve done.</p>
<p>Ergo, any communication open source project should “obviously” be
distributed under GPL v3. But, few are.</p>
<p>We can summarize by stating what criteria we consider to be necessary
beyond simply stating “we are open source”:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Only GPL v3 or similar license is acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>All parts of the system should be available under open source,
and we see no reason why there should be any variations.</p></li>
<li><p>To emphasize: there shouldn’t be any parts that are not available.</p></li>
<li><p>“Peripheral” aspects such as documentation, test suites, and so
forth, should all be included.</p></li>
<li><p>Development should be done in the open, so anybody can either
join in, or at a minimum follow along.</p></li>
<li><p>The aggregate system should be designed and maintained so as to
remain practical to use - simple to download, build, and run.</p></li>

<p>This means the design of the service is open to connecting to
other instances of the service, following open standards or at
least well documented and open sourced documentation.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Internet, this was a given. Email uses
standards like SMTP for transmission, RFC 5322 for the basic
formatting of emails, MIME standards to add new data types,
and POP3 and IMAP to specify how applications can talk to
email services.</p>
<p>With the advent of Internet as a Very Big Business, these traditions
and principles went away: the “walled garden” rules supreme.</p>
<p>Snackabra defines two primitives: a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Shard"><span class="xref std std-term">shard</span></a> and a
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-channel"><span class="xref std std-term">channel</span></a>. Services are built on those, and hosting them
is done in a fundamentally interoperable manner: there is no
central source of authority for logging in, for example, authentication
is done by means of channels.</p>

<p>The core design principles include, in strict order of priority:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Private by design - from the ground up, providing as much privacy
as possible, subject only to the design constraints (below).</p></li>
<li><p>As secure as possible, both with respect to third parties as well

<li><p>Transparent: from the beginning, prepare for future open sourcing,

<li><p>High performance and scalability.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize large, modern building blocks: leverage the “from scratch”
opportunity to both select current best-practice, as well as

</section>
<section id="accountability">
<h3>Accountability<a class="headerlink" href="#accountability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A brief note on accountability needs - they are rooted in the following deductions:</p>
<p>The Institute’s Mission is to “inform and empower Members
to defend their privacy and protect their information,” which
implies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We want to help as <em>many</em> people as possible</p></li>
<li><p>We want to help them in a <em>significant</em> way</p></li>
<li><p>We want to help them in a <em>sustainable</em> way over a long period of
time</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to two directions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We want to develop <em>and host</em> a service. We are doing
that on <a class="reference external" href="https://Privacy.App">https://Privacy.App</a> - if you become a Member,
you can both use that service, and you’re supporting the
efforts to develop snackabra and other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to <em>empower</em> individuals to run equivalent
(and interoperable) service(s), either for themselves
personally, or to host a paid-for service.
We are doing this by developing the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/snackabra">https://github.com/snackabra</a>
technology as open source, and without strange
footnotes, restrictions, or gotchas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to our own hosting, we arrive at a few principles
that relate to any Members:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>We cannot allow illegal activities. A liberal, democratic society
will not (and cannot) accept communication and collaboration
systems that are used for <em>clearly and unambiguously illegal</em>
activities. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f130" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f130b" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>We need to <em>pick one legal jurisdiction</em> - it’s beyond the scope
of this summary to walk through the exact details of this
consequence, but essentially what we find is that any attempt to
be “global” will constrain our ability to protect or help Members
and easily ends up becoming lowest common denominator. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f131" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f132" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
Since we are a US-based non-profit,
we are at a minimum subject to US law, ergo, we select US (and
only US) jurisdiction over us. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f133" id="id8" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>8<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>The minimum, practical, amount we need to know about you is (a)
you’re Human and (b) you are a United States resident (that you
are subject to - and only subject to - our single jurisdiction).</p></li>

<section id="deleting-recording-autodestruct-message-models">
<h3>Deleting / Recording / “Autodestruct” Message Models<a class="headerlink" href="#deleting-recording-autodestruct-message-models" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Some chat services make various claims about supporting messages to be
deleted, not downloadable, not recordable (even against screenshots),
etc.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, this is simply not true: it is not
something any chat service can geniunely promise. Period. The only way
to truly accomplish this would be to provide a tightly integrated
hardware, operating system, and application, from a single vendor. In
which case you now have to completely trust the vendor.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-thing-about-trust">
<h3>The thing about “Trust”<a class="headerlink" href="#the-thing-about-trust" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Allow us to elaborate. There is no such thing as zero trust
communication, outside of the realm of your own dreams, at night, that
you promptly forget upon waking up. Any communication with another
party, at a minimum you have to have some trust for that other
party. To generalize, if you are in a conversation with N participants
(counting yourself), you at a minimum have to trust all the others
(assuming you can trust yourself).</p>
<p>A communication system that is provided to your group by a third party
now requires you to trust at a minimum one more party (what we call
the “+1 effect”). But that minimum is not likely to actually be the
case. For example, if you’re using a “highly secure” messaging system
on your smartphone, you’re now needing to trust both the service
provider as well as the phone manufacturer. In all likelihood, in both
“camps” (app and phone), several more. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f102" id="id10" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>11<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Our objective with this design is to minimize these “trust-creep”
effects. As baseline, we split the system into (offline) CLI key and
identity generation, a separate SSO <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f103" id="id11" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>12<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> to manage
public room keys and Owner information, backend servers on Cloudflare,
and the frontend UI by default <em>not</em> a phone “app” but a simple
single-page web application. This separation is intended to make
ourselves the only <em>single</em> point of failure: more than one of these
separate systems would have to be compromised to penetrate your
privacy <em>with us knowing about it</em>.</p>
<p>That last part is key. The point being, if you trust us, you do not
have to trust <em>all</em> these underlying service providers that we use to
build a working system. Our objective is for that “+1” effect to be as
truly limited to “1” as possible.</p>
<p>But we also want to enable you to eliminate the “+1”. That is the
intent of the “restrict room” feature: re-generate keys that are
re-distributed between just the parties to the conversation, after
which we have no access to it, nor any of our underlying system or
service providers.</p>
<p id="micro-federation">But we also want to eliminate - or at least put into your control -
any other hidden trust functions. Our key to that is to allow for an
established chat to “leave” - we call this <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Micro-Federation"><span class="xref std std-term">Micro Federation</span></a>
and we’ve heard it referred to as <em>severability</em>:</p>
<p>Once a group is up and running, restricted, and the Owner has
“rotated” (taken control of) their keys, each participant will now
have in their local_storage the public keys for each and every other
participant, as well as the locked-in public key of who is Owner. If
somebody hosts a server, they just need to message (securely) the
address to that server, and everybody can “export” their keys and
settings, go to that server, “import” their keyfile, and they’re all
back. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f101" id="id12" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>10<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>This is currently supported as the “download” function in all rooms.
To “upload”, you need to have permissions to create a room on a
room server (such as by being the admin of a personal server).</p>
<p>The storage components (shared files, photos, etc) are orthogonal
to the chat element: objects are named based on their contents,
and are encrypted etc, so can be left on an origin server, or
also migrated to a personal storage server, as desired.</p>

<section id="what-do-we-and-others-mean-by-end-to-end-encryption">
<span id="end-to-end-encryption"></span><h3>What do we (and others) mean by End-to-End Encryption?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-we-and-others-mean-by-end-to-end-encryption" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>E2E (end-to-end) encryption means that only the (two) parties at each
end can read anything being transmitted, and nothing and nobody
in-between.</p>
<p>E2E is a little reminiscent of “zero trust” systems. In a literal,
purist sense, there is no such thing. You would have to prove a
negative: that nobody has tampered with your iPhone for example, or
that your messaging app doesn’t have malicious code specifically
targeting <em>you</em> for intercepting messages, etc.</p>
<p>Absent a clear community consensus about the terminology, we will
distinguish between “conventional” E2E and “true” E2E. Neither can be
defined in a completely clear manner, especially the latter, but we
believe an earnest attempt is better than glossing over.</p>
<p>Conventional E2E is a communication system that, <em>assuming you trust
and believe statements regarding the implementation of all it’s
parts</em>, is secure in the sense that only the two parties can (ever)
read the messages.</p>
<p>Serious providers of secure messaging make no bones about this. For
example, Telegram goes to some length <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f104" id="id13" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>13<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> to
discuss the various trade-offs; notably they gloss it over <em>slightly</em>
for new users by talking about “client-to-client” encryption, but the
most nominal effort to inform yourself from their documentation will
make their trade-offs clear. This, we feel, is appropriate for a
product that aims at a mass market.</p>
<p>Others are not so forthcoming. When Apple’s iMessenger protocol design
and features were first introduced and discussed in detail in 2013, it
was quickly pointed out that at the end of the day you still needed to
trust Apple. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f105" id="id14" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>14<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>To which the corporate giant’s spokesperson helpfully stated “The
research discussed theoretical vulnerabilities that would require
Apple to re-engineer the iMessage system to exploit it, and Apple has
no plans or intentions to do so.” Which in English means, yes, you
still need to trust us. The underlying limitation is (as almost
always) key management.</p>
<p>The other category of common security weakness in even the most
earnest efforts at privacy and security is the need to ultimately
trust the system being used - such as the website/browser/computer or
the app/phone combos. If any of the key parts are compromised, even if
temporarily or inadvertently (such as by a bug or security problem
that is legitimately not known to the parties assembling the parts),
then somebody can read your messages. We’ll call whatever you’re
running your communication on, your ‘platform.’</p>
<p>Other than those two areas, we posit that the rest is a small matter
of applying best practices - selecting proper cryptographic
algorithms, subjecting protocol designs to careful third party review,
being open and transparent with the broader community about the
design, etc (which by no means implies it’s easy to do).</p>
<p>These and other experiences prompt us to define conventional E2E
something like this: it is secure communication between each end (two
parties), assuming neither that the necessary key management solution
nor your client platform have been compromised or are being operated
maliciously.</p>
<p>Next, we define “true” E2E as an approach that tries to accomplish
best practice in these two areas. For example, if you can separately
verify the keys in some manner, then that addresses (in part) concerns
on key management.</p>
<p>More tricky is to trust the client platform. For example, any
web-based system relies on a web server to deliver the application,
making your client environment susceptible to any code injected from
the server. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f106" id="id15" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>15<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  This limits the efficacy of key
verification as per above - since the app was in control of the
private side of those keys prior to the verification. An open source
approach on the client software helps, but not if it cannot connect to
the core (global) service, and not if it doesn’t have an open source
ecosystem (including servers). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f107" id="id16" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>16<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>E2E is about security, not privacy. For example, any messaging system
that requires you to use a phone number to authenticate is
<em>emphatically *not private. Any messaging system that uses the *same</em>
cryptographic credentials (such as a public key unique to you) for
every separate conversation is not private either. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f108" id="id17" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>17<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Any system
that depends on some other system (such as SMS or notification) for
any part of the lifecycle of a conversation, is not private. Etc. The
simple answer why it’s easier to acquire <em>secure</em> communications
rather than <em>private</em> communications, is that the former is generally
not a factor in monetization, the latter is. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f109" id="id18" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>18<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Our design attempts to address all of the above; here’s a partial
recap (not all of these items are implemented yet):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A room name is a global, unique, and persistent URI.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to be authenticated by the server to <em>create</em> a room, and
thus be permanent Owner of it, but you’re free to “pick up and
leave” with the full conversation, including the set of participants
and keys, at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>All communication is end-to-end encrypted, initially with key
management provided by the server, but optionally the Owner can take
over key management.</p></li>
<li><p>Public key identifiers are unique for every participant and every
room.</p></li>
<li><p>Anybody can join and become a participant using just the room name
(and server).</p></li>
<li><p>Directory of rooms and “contacts” are kept in client local storage
by each participant. This state can be exported to another browser
or device, bringing your identity <em>for those rooms</em> with you.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of room, Owner, and participants, can rotate their keys and
disconnect from the server of origin, taking direct control of their
keys.</p></li>
<li><p>The client platform is default provided by the server, but a static
(locally hosted) html file can serve as client as well.</p></li>
<li><p>All the parts will be open sourced and we will publish and maintain
this design doc.</p></li>

<section id="the-insider-privacy-model">
<h3>The “Insider” Privacy Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-insider-privacy-model" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>If you are not familiar with the extent to which you <strong>lack</strong> privacy
and protections in currently available messaging systems and services,
e.g. if you are not well-informed about online security and current
practices of law enforcement and the courts, then the following
discourse may strike you as an <strong>incursion</strong> and <strong>restriction</strong> of
your privacy. That is not true. Most “big tech” services will simply
not tell you the measures and processes that they have in place, on a
daily basis, to collaborate with law enforcement. Many “privacy
startups” won’t tell you who owns or controls their company, leaving
future use of any collected data (especially metadata) unprotected.
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f110" id="id19" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>19<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Many services are based outside the US or the EU, making any policy
assurances on their websites unenforceable. You should know that in
the face of law enforcement requests or subpoenas, any privacy policy
more or less does not apply. Instead of reacting to legitimate law
enforcement needs as an afterthought, we have determined that the best
way to maximize your protection is to talk about the challenges
explicitly, walk you through them, and explain how we are designing
our system to accomplish as balance.</p>
<p>Implicit in this design is a notion - which might be an innovation -
of the “Insider Privacy Model.”  A practical communications service
requires some minimal mechanisms for law enforcement to combat illegal
usage. There are bad things out there, and a broader, liberal, society
will accept dark corners of any relevant scale.</p>
<p>The restricted room with user-controlled keys is perhaps the main
accomplishment of this overall design. Once this is set up and
running, only the Owner and approved participants can access any of
the content, including shared images (and documents), even if the
service managed by us is still providing connectivity and
storage. This is sometimes referred to as <em>digital sovereignty</em>,
namely, as a user you should be able to understand, and ultimately
take control of, any code that is controlling your communications.</p>
<p>In principle, the service provider (ourselves as baseline) can assist
with (legal) wiretap requests directly as long as the room is not
restricted. If the room is locked down <em>while *some form of wiretap or
surveillance request in a room is active, then the generated keys
could *in principle</em> be captured by some form of injected code, but we
will enable and document sample strict procedures that an Owner of a
room can take to stop even that (or at least detect it).</p>
<p>Ergo, a properly locked room cannot be wiretapped without help of <em>at
least one participant</em> in that room - not by any combination of
ourselves, any and all infrastructure and cloud service providers, and
law enforcement, to the very best of our design ability.</p>
<p>This (naturally) leaves key management with the participants, and the
trust basis as well. As long as the private keys of all the
participants are kept safe, nobody can read the contents of exchanged
messages. They are all created locally. Once a room is locked, only
the Owner private key can authorize any administrative functions, such
as approving a new participant. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f111" id="id20" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>20<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>This brings the question of, in a (fully) legitimate law enforcement
request for assistance, that we (voluntarily and according to our
principles of maximum privacy) agree with, what measure can be taken?
What if something truly horrible is going on? Obviously the room can
be shut down <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f112" id="id21" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>21<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and in addition any associated membership service
can be suspended. But is there a way to tap into the conversation?</p>
<p>Yes, but law enforcement would need an insider - they would need the
assistance of somebody in the group, or figure out a way to get
somebody added to the group that will help them. This is what we refer
to as the “Insider Model” of privacy. For a serious enough situation,
law enforcement will have both the resources and the capability to
accomplish this.</p>
<p>We feel that this approach serves as a practical ‘check’ on the
seriousness of any supposed illegality. It also deliberately attempts
to align any effort needed for <em>digital *surveillance with *physical</em>
surveillance. It simply should not be simpler and cheaper - by orders
of magnitude - to run surveillance on virtual conversations than it is
for in-person conversations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this design protects an established set of participants
in a group from being disconnected from each other - <em>resilience</em> -
something related to, but independent of, security and privacy:
defense against attempts to interfere with, or stop, a conversation
(independent of access to content). All the necessary keys and
identities are contained in the (distributed) set of key files amongst
the participants. The system is naturally capable of fragmentation
(<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Micro-Federation"><span class="xref std std-term">Micro Federation</span></a>) we aim to make it relatively simple for a group
to set up a server, ‘reconnect’ various keys, re-populate messages,
and get back on track with any ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>We also plan to support <em>chunking</em> a conversation, a thread, as a
single object, that can be shared and untangled for reading - with
authorship keys retained for any future validation.</p>
<p>The design also has an inherent nature of the right to <em>disassociate</em>
yourself from a conversation. Any non-Owner participant can just
delete their keys, and that’s it: other participants can read their
old messages, but new ones can’t be written, and nobody can come along

<p>An analogy here might be: if a group of individuals meet to discuss
something illegal in the real world, then if law enforcement really
cares, they’re likely to not only be able to recruit or insert an
informant with a recording device, but also to be able to execute
simultaneous search warrants against multiple participants afterwards
(phones, laptops, notepads). This is appropriate: it creates a natural
counter force (expense and effort) against trivially pursuing
surveillance, whether legal or not, against large numbers of groups -
notably broad “fishing” expeditions.</p>
<p>What we have pursued in this design is to accomplish something in the
digital domain that is more similar to “real world” conversations that
existed before all of this marvelous technology:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>to make it easy for you to “get together” conversationally,</p></li>
<li><p>decide for yourself who is in the conversation,</p></li>
<li><p>share any information you like,</p></li>
<li><p>and be secure in the knowledge that you cannot easily be spied upon</p></li>
</ul>

it’s impossible to provide a clear definition, but we
will err on the side of privacy. Social norms not

anybody else can host servers.</p>

<p>For example, a driving force of the internet industry to
identify who you are is actually driven by needing to
know where you are and what you are (robot or
human). By constraining to United States residents, and
selling memberships only through person-to-person
transactions, we can represent on behalf of our members
viz any online services that anybody connecting through
our systems is by definition a human, US resident, with
appropriate rights, which we in turn will aggressively
fight on behalf for.</p>

<p>This also ties into micro-federation and our intent to provide
FOSS versions of public (multi-owner) server code as well.

<p>Any complete system will need a separate authentication
model for “Owner”. In our first implementation, for our
version of the service only Members of the Privacy.App
service can be Owners. If you run the system yourself, you
will need some mechanism for Owners to “log in”; details
later in document.</p>

<p>Note: once an Owner “rotates” their keys, the identity of
the Owner is locked-in for every participant - at their
end. It cannot be changed, the participant clients will no
longer accept “Admin” requests unless signed with the new
Owner keys - which neither the original server (that
created the room) nor the new server has access to. This
allows an (intended) extreme form of resilience - the group
can continue to leave any new server, or re-visit any old
server, with the same set of keys, and be able to continue
a conversation on any server in any order, without any of
those servers ever being able to read any parts of the
conversation. Owner can be “re-rooted” in a new “home” by
simply copying their rotated private key)</p>

<p>For example, the CPU manufacturer for that phone, if it’s
not fully integrated. The underlying DNS provider might be
a dependency, not to mention the datacenter operator that
the messaging app is using for their servers. The
notification system for the phone app is probably uniquely
identifying you. Etc.</p>

<p>For example, this is a (fundamental) limitation of a secure
email service that provides a web interface, such as
ProtonMail. See references for an analysis, but briefly,
whereas malicious code in an app delivered across an app
store will at least leave a trail with the app store
provider, malicious code from a web server (or an
intermediary) can be both targeted and fleeting, removing
itself when done.</p>

<p>For example, the Telegram FAQ has stated “Our architecture

July 2014. Federation would imply losing control over much
of the meta-data.</p>

<p>Since the meta-data implied by tracking what public keys
are talking to what other public keys constitute your
conversation pattern, both as an individual and, in
particular, a growing graph of information about who talks
to whom, for how long, and when, and in what order are new
connections made, etc etc. These were concerns that were
less well understood in the past.)</p>

<p>If you are using a messaging product that’s free to use,
does not worry much about how many images or documents you
are storing for free, but somehow wants to know who is in
your contact list and who you are talking to … well then
you are probably the product. You could ask their owners to
see what their business plan is. Assuming you can figure
out who the controlling owners are. Or where.</p>

<p>As a general rule under US law, no commitments from a
service provider is enforceable against a new company that
acquires them, or a third party who has access to or
licenses their data. And contrary to popular opinion,
(stock) ownership is not the same as control, for example
most startups that have received investment money will be
subject to “investor agreements” regulating board
composition.</p>

<p>Or change of keys - to rotate keys you will need the
current Owner ones. This means if the Owner loses their
private key for a locked room, then there is no simple way
to reset or recover access, but the participants can always
simply communicate to arrange for a new room to be
created.)</p>
</aside>
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="f112" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id21">21</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>Even that, not necessarily - a server can only delete a
room in it’s own database. The Owner may have moved the
room to another server, or themself set up a server. Any
participant that has downloaded their message history will
still has access to it using a static client.</p>

<aside class="footnote brackets" id="f113" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id22">22</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>Note: the Owner who created the room remains accountable,
as long as the (SSO) service is managing their keys. This
creates a deliberate safeguard: if the room is co-opted by
participants to some purpose that’s not ‘ok’ with the
Owner, including any illegal activity that the Owner wants
nothing to do with, then the Owner can close the room. The
conversation can only be migrated with permission of the
Owner. If the other participants want to move the
conversation, one of them needs to create a new room, at
which point they are the new (accountable) Owner. This
provides a point in time for an Owner to disavow a
conversation should they choose to do so: close the room
(so no further activity can take place) and, optionally,
report any issues of concern to the hosting provider. This is to allow a
natural, human behavior: if you’re a guest (participant)
and you don’t like where a conversation is going, you can
leave. If you’re the host (Owner), you can kick anybody out
that you want to, and if it comes to it, you can kick
everybody out of your house.</p>
